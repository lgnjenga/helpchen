## Making Changes Locally

2. Change into the directory of the cloned repository

   ```bash
   cd repository

3. Make changes to the files as needed. 

## Adding Changes and Committing:
	```bash
	git add .
	git commit -m "Your commit message"

## Pushing Changes to GitHub:
	```bash
	git push origin master

## Pulling Changes from GitHub:
	```bash
	git pull origin master

## Additional Tips:

### Branching:
- Create and switch to a new branch using git checkout -b branch-name.
- Push the branch to GitHub using git push origin branch-name.

### Viewing Remote Information:
- Check remote URLs with git remote -v.
- View details of a specific remote with git remote show origin.

### Updating Forks:

- If you forked a repository, keep it up-to-date with the original using:
	```bash
	git pull upstream master 

	(after adding the original repository as a remote).
